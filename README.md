# irrigation-springler

## Introduction

Irrigation may play a vital role in commercial fruit growing as well as in flower gardens. To date, however, there has been little easy availability of smart, scalable and last but not least open source software for this kind of industry. The purpose of this project is to develop a set of microservices in order to provide useful features for digital gardening with a special focus on water management.
The project presented here leverages the Spring Framework to implement the needed services. In order to build a scalable solution, Apache Kafka is used to connect the services and providing stream-processing.


java project with spring to provide smart irrigation services

# Install Kafka binaries for debugging

- get the latest release

`wget https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.0.0/kafka_2.13-3.0.0.tgz`

- extract the package

`tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.0.0.tgz`

- move the folder to a proper dir

`mv kafka_2.13-3.0.0 /usr/bin`

- add binaries to PATH

`export PATH="/usr/bin/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin:$PATH"`

- test by typing first

`kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 -create --topic test_topic --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`

- and testing secondly by

`kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 -list`
